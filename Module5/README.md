Pymaceuticals

Description: 
A clinical studies was ran on mice with SCC, in order to analyze the effect of different treatments, on the size of their tumor. Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy, and NumPy were used in order to find data and make graphs. 

Analysis: 
Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest average tumor volumes, with a mean of 40.6 (mm3) and 40.2 (mm3). The data is accurate, as Infubinol is the only treatment that had an outlier. A random mouse for Capomulin was chosen (x401), and a line plot shows the mouse's tumor size significantly decreasing over a span of 40 days. There's a correlation between the weight of the mouse and the tumor size, the heavier the mouse, the larger the tumor.

I would like to give a big thank you to our AskBCS Learning Assistants, as they helped me several times througoughout the module to assist with codes I was stuck on. ChatGPT also gave many helpful tips on how to approach different codes. I also came across many helpful sites throughout the web, in which helped me lay the grounds of my code. They are as follow:
